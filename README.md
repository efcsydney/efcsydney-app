### Install ###

Before installation, you need to have the following tools ready in your machine.

Follow the steps in [React Native Getting Started](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html) tutorial.
    * Node.js - Tested only on 6.10.3
    * yarn - Tried with `npm` but it fails. 

Execute the following script 

```
#!bash
git clone git@bitbucket.org:josephj/efcsermon2.git;
cd efcSermon2;
yarn 
```

* Run the app
    * `react-native run-ios` or `react-native run-android`
    * Sometimes you have to run from XCode or Android Studio.
